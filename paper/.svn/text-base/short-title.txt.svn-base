<I>Applying Image Analogies to Video</I><BR>
"Image Analogy" is a form of image processing which uses an image A and an altered version of that image A’ to produce an image B’ with similar alterations from some other image B (A:A’::B:B’).  Image analogies have a wide range of applications including traditional filters, imitating artistic styles, and texture transfer. A natural extension of this process is to apply the analogy to a segment of video rather than another image. While a trivial implementation of simply applying the analogy to each frame independently may produce an acceptable video in some situations,  additional processing is often required to produce a consistent and visually pleasing result.  The purpose of this project is to develop a range of techniques for computing image-to-video analogies and to compare the effectiveness of these techniques in several common applications of image analogies.
